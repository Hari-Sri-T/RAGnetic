    "# RAG Pipeline: From Document to Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete, advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We will take a raw document (like a PDF insurance policy), process it, store its knowledge permanently, and then build an intelligent query engine that can answer questions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Persistent Knowledge:** Uses `ChromaDB` to store document knowledge so it's not forgotten.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Search:** Combines traditional keyword search (`BM25`) with modern semantic search for the best of both worlds.\n",
    "- **Advanced Reranking:** Uses a `Cross-Encoder` to deeply analyze initial search results and find the absolute best context.\n",
    "- **Intelligent Routing:** Can determine if a question is related to the document or is a general knowledge query."

      "[ 💬 Answer (General Mode) ]: The provided text appears to be a placeholder or template for various questions that someone might search for online. It does not contain specific information but rather prompts users to ask certain types of inquiries related to their personal circumstances, such as age, gender (M/F), marital status, employment type and seniority level, financial situation (income range or savings amount).\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance: \n",
      "1. The user might want information about how maternity leave policies vary across different countries for a female individual aged between 20-35 years old with an income in the bracket of $40k-$60k, looking to become pregnant and seeking part-time employment at junior level seniority.\n",
      "    - According to various sources including United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO), maternity leave policies differ across countries based on their own regulations. Some nations provide paid parental leaves with a duration of up to 18 months, like Sweden and France, while others offer only unpaid or shorter periods such as the USA that does not mandate any federal laws for employers regarding this matter but provides stateside Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) which permits eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave.\n",
      "    - In general, many countries support maternity leaves with varying durations and paid benefits; it's essential for expecting mothers or couples considering pregnancy in a particular country should thoroughly research the laws applicable there as they often change due to social progressions. \n",
      "\n",
      "The template also includes personal demographic details which are not related specifically to maternity leave applicability but provide context about an individual seeking such information:\n",
      "2. The user might be searching for general career advice or resources tailored towards a female, middle-aged professional with several years of experience in the IT industry and looking for ways to advance their seniority level through upskilling opportunities within New York City's economic landscape given limited savings (under $10K).\n",
      "    - There are numerous online platforms like Udemy or Coursera that provide courses relevant to an individual’ end career goals. Networking events, industry-specific conferences and meetups can help gain valuable insights into the IT sector in NYC while connecting with potential mentors who could support professional growth ambitions through job opportunities or partnerships for upskilling initiatives.\n",
      "    - Given financial constraints due to limited savings ($10K), it might be advisable to explore scholarship programs, employer-sponsored training and tuition assistance options available in NYC that can potentially reduce the cost burden associated with professional development courses or seminars which are often offered by local universities like Columbia University MBA Program.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while there is no direct information about maternity leave applicability provided within this template text itself; understanding related policies across different countries and seeking advice tailored towards personal circumstances would be crucial for making informed decisions regarding potential career moves or family-related plans such as pregnancy in the future.\n",

      "[ 💬 Answer (General Mode) ]: To accurately answer your question about whether the cost of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is covered under any insurance plan or policy you might hold, I would need more details. The coverage can vary greatly depending on several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Type of Insurance**: Whether it's health, life, maternity, fertility-specific, or other types of policies that could potentially cover IVF treatments. Some insurance plans are designed specifically for this purpose and may include coverage details in their benefits summary or policy handbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Policy Details**: Each individual plan can have specific clauses about what is covered under fertility treatments, which might be detailed within the document itself - not just at a glance but also possibly buried deep inside with sub-clauses and notes that you may need to review in full detail or discuss directly with an insurance representative.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Country Regulations**: If your IVF treatment was done outside of India, it's crucial to check if there are specific regulations regarding foreign treatments coverage based on where the procedure took place and what kind of healthcare system is in operation at that time (public or private). Some countries have very strict policies about insurance claims for such services.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Coverage Limits**: Even when IVF treatment might be covered, there's usually a limit to how much the insurance will pay out per cycle and possibly on lifetime coverage too. You may also need prior authorization from your insurer before undergoing the procedure as some treatments are not automatically covered just because they’re medically necessary in certain contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Out-of-Pocket Expenses**: The total cost of an IVF cycle can include non-insurance related expenses like medication, egg retrieval and embryo transfer fees which might be completely out-of-pocket based on your insurance terms or the specific fertility clinic's policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Wait Times**: Some plans have a waiting period before they start to cover certain procedures due to their classification as elective, non-emergency treatments even when there are medical reasons for seeking them. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven’t done so already, I would highly recommend reaching out directly to your insurance provider or reviewing the documents provided by both the fertility clinic and your healthcare plan thoroughly in order to understand what specific costs might be covered and which ones will need to come from personal funds. They can also guide on how to proceed with any necessary paperwork for claim processing if IVF is indeed a covered benefit under your insurance policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most accurate information, you should directly consult: \n",
      "- Your healthcare provider or fertility clinic about their policies regarding third-party payments (such as those from an insurer). They may have already communicated with various providers on payment methods and can guide through this complex process if there's a possibility of coverage. You might also ask them to submit the necessary claims documentation directly, which then will be forwarded for processing by your insurance company.\n",
      "- Your insurance provider or their representatives – they are always best placed to provide specific details about what is and isn’t covered under different plans including any deductibles, co-pays, limits on coverage per cycle/year, necessary preauthorizations, etc., as well as information regarding the claims process if IVF treatment costs fall within your plan's scope.\n",

      "return sum(table_of_factors[:-1])*factorial(table_of_factors[-1])/len(table_of_factors[:-1])\n",
      "```\n",
      "This function uses a list to store the factors of `n` and calculates their factorials by recursively calling itself for each number. Finally, it sums up all these values (excepting last one because we don't need its actual value), multiplies them together while also adding in n-1 times 2*3...*(n-1) to get the result of `n!`. It then divides this sum by `(n-len(table_of_factors[:-1]))` which is effectively calculating a harmonic average, but I've included it as per your request for demonstration purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: This implementation can be quite slow due to its high time complexity (O(n^2)). If you need better performance with larger inputs, consider implementing an iterative approach or using memoization techniques like dynamic programming which significantly improve the execution speed by avoiding redundant calculations and keeping track of previously computed values.\n",

It should provide diverse diagnostic and therapeutic services, suggesting facilities like imaging centers (MRI/CT), laboratories, chemotherapy units or similar specialties are part of its offerings to be considered a 'Hospital' under this policy definition. The emphasis on admission capability without need for immediate transfer from other institutions highlights the self-sufficiency and comprehensive nature expected in such facilities as per these standards. \n",
