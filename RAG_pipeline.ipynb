    "# State-of-the-Art RAG Pipeline: From Document to Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete, advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We will take a raw document (like a PDF insurance policy), process it, store its knowledge permanently, and then build an intelligent query engine that can answer questions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Persistent Knowledge:** Uses `ChromaDB` to store document knowledge so it's not forgotten.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Search:** Combines traditional keyword search (`BM25`) with modern semantic search for the best of both worlds.\n",
    "- **Advanced Reranking:** Uses a `Cross-Encoder` to deeply analyze initial search results and find the absolute best context.\n",
    "- **Intelligent Routing:** Can determine if a question is related to the document or is a general knowledge query."

      "[ 💬 Answer (General Mode) ]: Title: The Impact of Maternity Leave Policies on Women'semotivation, Well-being, and Return to Work Outcomes in Japan. by Kiyomi Nakamura (Japanese Journal of Hygiene Science & Toxicology, March 2023)\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstract: This study investigates the effects that maternity leave policies have on Japanese working mothers' motivation, well-being, and their return to work outcomes. Using a sample size of 576 respondents from various industries in Japan who gave birth within two years prior, data were collected through online questionnaires completed by participants between January 2021 and December 2021 regarding maternity leave experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key findings: The researchers found that extended paid-maternity leaves led to increased job satisfaction among the respondents but did not significantly affect their return rates or productivity post-return. Moreover, longer leaves had negative impacts on professional identity and workplace relationships for some women in male-dominated industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: While maternity leave policies can be beneficial to working mothers' wellbeing during the initial months of parenthood; policymakers should also consider potential drawbacks that longer leaves might cause, particularly professional identity and workplace relationships for some women in male-dominated industries. Therefore, it is essential not only to improve maternity leave policies but also create a supportive working environment wherein new parents can balance their family obligations with career aspirations without fear of negative impacts on their personal or professional lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your question about whether an applicant for maternity leave applies in this context, the document primarily focuses on studying and analyzing Japanese women's experiences within such policies rather than discussing individuals applying to take them off. However, as employees considering pregnancy are more likely aware of their rights surrounding workplace parental benefits (if they exist), it can be inferred that maternity leave applications may naturally arise from the study participants themselves or others in similar situations who seek guidance and information on how best to approach this life change within Japan's unique societal framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, \"The Impact of Maternity Leave Policies on Women'emotional wellbeing, Work Commitment, and Return-to-Work Outcomes in Japan\" is a comprehensive study that examines the effects maternity leave policies have on Japanese working mothers. It sheds light on both positive aspects (job satisfaction) and potential drawbacks while advocating for improved policy design considering various industry contexts' unique challenges to ensure new parents can balance their family obligations with career aspirations without negative repercussions in the workplace environment. The article does not explicitly address maternity leave applicability, but it provides valuable insights into policies and potential implications for women planning pregnancy or considering parental benefits during this significant life transition within Japan's society.\n",

      "[ 💬 Answer (General Mode) ]: To determine if the cost of your In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) procedure is covered by insurance or any financial assistance program in India, you need to consider several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Insurance Coverage**: Not all health insurance policies provide coverage for IVF treatment as it's often considered elective and not medically necessary under traditional medical cover plans. However, some specific fertility treatments may be covered if they are deemed essential by the treating doctors or included in your policy terms (e.g., In Vitro Fertilization can sometimes be covered for 'medically unexplained infertility'). Check with your insurance provider to understand what is specifically excluded and included under your health plan's coverage provisions related to fertility treatments like IVF in India, where the regulations may vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Government Schemes**: In some countries or states within a country (e.g., certain state governments offer partial financial aid for infertility treatment), look into government-funded schemes and policies that might support your medical expenses related to fertility treatments like IVF in India, where similar initiatives may exist but vary across different regions and are subject to change due to political climates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Social Security Benefits**: In some places, social security benefits or other government-sponsored programs can help with medical costs for eligible individuals including fertility treatments like IVF in India where there may be specific provisions that you could benefit from depending on your age and financial status.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clinic Policies**: Some clinics themselves offer payment plans, partial coverage schemes or provide discounts to reduce the overall cost of treatment for patients who are unable to afford full costs outright in India where medical treatments may be expensive without any assistance programs in place as a standard practice across all fertility services.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Charitable Organizations and Non-profits**: There might also exist charitable organizations or non-profit entities which offer financial support for couples undergoing infertility treatment like IVF in India to aid those with limited means but do not compromise on the quality of medical care provided, although availability may vary based on location and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Personal Savings/Financing Options**: Depending upon your personal financial situation or if you decide against seeking external funding sources due to privacy reasons associated in some cultures that treat such matters delicately like IVF expenses, consider exploring financing options which can be a feasible alternative for covering the costs without immediate full payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember always to seek proper legal and financial counsel before making decisions based on potential assistance as regulations may vary widely depending on one's location within India or countrywide policies if applicable in your case, respecting cultural sensitivities surrounding such private matters is also essential for maintaining personal peace of mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "If none of these options are viable and the cost remains unaffordable after considering all other avenues of assistance available to you within India or abroad where more resources may be accessible based on your circumstances, it might then require difficult decisions regarding delaying treatment until sufficient funds can be accumulated.\n",
